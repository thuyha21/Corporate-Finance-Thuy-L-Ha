## Self-audit checklist

Your validation report must address each of these checks:

| Check | What to verify |
|-------|---------------|
| Balance Sheet balances | Assets = Liabilities + Equity (both years) |
| Du Pont ROA consistency | Du Pont ROA (Margin x Turnover) ≈ Direct ROA |
| Du Pont ROE consistency | Du Pont ROE ≈ Direct ROE |
| Sign checks | No negative ratios where impossible |
| Reasonableness | Ratios fall within plausible industry ranges |
| Named range audit | Spot-check 5 named ranges → correct cells |
| Formula audit | Spot-check 5 formulas → correct inputs |
| Start-of-year vs. average | Compare and explain any divergence |
